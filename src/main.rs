/* THIS CODE IS TO POWER AND UNPOWER AN LED AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS

USES GPIO PIN 21, which is the same as PIN 40
 * (dont forget to add the target -> `rustup target add armv7a-none-eabi`)

 * although the [datasheet](https://cs140e.sergio.bz/docs/BCM2837-ARM-Peripherals.pdf) states that address `0x7E000000` is where you should move data to, the actual physical address located at `0x3F00 0000`, so that is what I will be referencing (page 6; '1.2.3 ARM physical addresses')


In order to make PIN 21 OUTPUT, so I must write `001` to bits 3-5, so basically...

|   address   | written bits | what it does |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| 0x3F00 0000 | N/A          | base address | <- for ref
+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| 0x3F20 0008 |1<<3;0<<4;0<<5| gpio 21 OUT  |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| 0x3F20 001C | 1<<21        | gpio 21 ON   |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| 0x3F20 0028 | 1<<21        | gpio 21 OFF  |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+


 * we get the address `0x7E20 0008` from 'Table 6-4 â€“ GPIO Alternate function select register 2' (page 93) and looking that up in the table of registers (page 90; 'Table 6-1 GPIO Register Assignment')

 * we get the address `0x7E20 001C` from 'Table 6-8 â€“ GPIO Output Set Register 0' (page 95). Since 21 is in the range 0..=31, 0 is used and we find the address in the table (page 90; 'Table 6-1 GPIO Register Assignment')
 * * same logic used to find address `0x7E20 0028`: 1..=31 so use 0
